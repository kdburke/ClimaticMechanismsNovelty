Data folder: The input data for the linear mixed effects modelling analyses. Each file contains the vegetation dissimilarity values, binned to 500-year intervals, in conjunction with the gridded climatic mechanism data. Seasonal climate data associated with the local sample are also included.

Results folder: The fitted coefficients of all candidate mixed effects models and the Relative Variable Importance (Akaike weights) of each variable, by region.
